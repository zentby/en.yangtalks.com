After witnessed the success of Amazon, Shopify, Alibaba, PDD and other e-commerce websites, Google joined the battlefield finally.

It's might not be a good time to start this now, based on the mess of the economy after the covid-19 and having so many giant competitors. 

On the other hand, it's also the best time for being so late.

Additionally, that could be the reason why they promotes it as "commission free".

Looking at the future of the product, it might be ended up like many other Google-made consumer facing products, e.g. Google+/Inbox/[etc.](https://killedbygoogle.com/), being abandoned with the free of responsibilities.
