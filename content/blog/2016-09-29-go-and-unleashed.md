Recently I opened a new project called "[go-unleashed](https://github.com/zentby/go-unleashed)". It's an Unleashed API client written in golang. As my first go project it is deeply inspired by [go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github). You would feel they are really familiar as I'm trying to learn test driven golang development by the two projects.

"go-unleashed" is already finished for development. Though there still some endpoints are missing but I'm not gonna add them for now. Feel free to create an issue or create a pull request or fork for your own and change on your own needs.
