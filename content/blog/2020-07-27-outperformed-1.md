On July 8, 2020, GitHub deposited 21 TB of data into the Archive, beneath 250 m (820 ft) of permafrost. The archive is part of [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) that is designed to last at least 1000 years for the future generations.

I couldn't imagine how would the future people think of our codes. If they were more intelligent than what we are, they probably will laugh at us and throw them away. On the other hand, if they are a new species from doomed world, they probably wouldn't understand what those magic characters mean. The only scenario that could these archive being used, probably is for the survived human beings from the doomed world, who can hugely accelerate their information rebuilding after they figure out how to build the set of infrastructures of a software and internet.


## Digest

#### [You've only added two lines - why did that take two days!](https://www.mrlacey.com/2020/07/youve-only-added-two-lines-why-did-that.html)

This article explains why it's impossible to measure a developer's effort by the lines of code. It also illustrates how a simple bug/change may related to a deep hole from a bigger picture.

#### [Dates and Times in JavaScript – A New API for Dates from TC39](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23781819)

Date and time processing has been a pain in many languages. Especially in JavaScript it's almost impossible to deal with it without a library.

One of the commenter suggested

> the JavaScript people, the Java people, the PHP people, the Perl people, the Python people, the C people, the C++ people, and the people for every other significant language that supports functions (either directly or as methods on objects) to get together and once and for all agree on how the heck we are supposed to deal with times and dates"

### [Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)](https://crdt.tech/)

A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that simplifies distributed data storage systems and multi-user applications.

It sounds like a promising solution for multi-user collaborating tasks (e.g. note taking!).


### [Five common mistakes writing react components](https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/)

The author provides a few common good practices when using React Hooks.

The author's website has a very interesting homepage too.

## Talk

### [The wet codebase](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2019/dan-abramov-the-wet-codebase)

A tech talk from [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io), the author of `redux` and core contributor of ReactJs. In this talk, he explained why "strict adherence to writing code that is free of duplication inevitably leads to **software we can’t understand**".
